Uses pariwise alignment to find if two sequences are similar or not.
Returns True if percentage of identity is greater than 95%, and False if it is not.

Compares both chains from the the input structures.
Return True if both sequences from one structure are similar to one or both sequences from the other structure.

Extracts the structures and the sequences from PDB input files.
Checks if we are dealing with homodimer interactions or heterodimer interactions.
Returns the pairwise interaction and True if there are homodimers and False if there are heterodimers.
