# Reconstruction of a macro-complex using interacting subunits

This project aims to construct a whole protein complex using pair of interacting chains.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you how to install the package and use it.

### Prerequisites

There are package required to run the program. These packages are Biopython (Bio), re, sys, os, subprocess, argparse, string, copy and numpy. If you do not have them installed, you can install them using the following command:

```
pip install biopython
```
You must find the correct name to install the package. All of them offer alternatives of installations.

### Installing

To install the package first unzip the folder:

```
tar -xzfcv complex_reconstr.tar.gz
```

Change the directory to the folder and execute setup script:

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

At the end, you will be able to use it as a package and also as a script.

##Running the program

To run the program use the following command:

```
python complex_reconstruction.py -i [inputs] -o [outputs] -v -vz
```

All functions are optionals, but it is important to write inputs and outputs. 

You will find more information about the program, how to run it, tests and options explained in the written project.
